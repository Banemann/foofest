# Front End Design Elective

## Autumn 2021

Your task is to build two systems for our festival called FooFest.

For that purpose, we have a lot of data, but more on that later.

## System 1, the booking site

We need you to build a site where users can:

- Buy tickets
- Reserve a "slot" at the different camping areas
- The user must also be able to associate various other products/services to their tickets

  - green camping option + 249
  - ticket prize

    - Regular 799
    - VIP 1299

  - Prebook camping area 99
  - Tents including set up (requires pre booking)
    - 2 person 299
    - 3 person 399

## System 2, the festival app

We need you to build a webapp where the user can get an overview of:

- the bands playing at the festival
- who's playing, where
- any cancellations that might occur.

You are free to add other features to help the guests explore the music, like browsing by genre, searching etc
