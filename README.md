# Front End Design Elective - Spring 2020

## Overview

Your task is to build two systems for our festival called FooFest.

For that purpose, we have a lot of data, but more on that later.

## System 1, the booking site

We need you to build a site where users can:

- Buy tickets
- Reserve a "spot" at the different camping areas
- The user must also be able to associate various other products/services to their tickets

[Requirements for the booking site](FORM-REQUIREMENTS.md)

## System 2, the festival app

We need you to build a webapp where the user can get an overview of:

- the bands playing at the festival
- who's playing, where
- Optionally: any cancellations that might occur.

[Requirements for the festival app](APP-REQUIREMENTS.md)

## The API

The backend team has created a little documentation for you guys.
