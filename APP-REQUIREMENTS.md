# Front End Design Elective - Spring 2020

## System 2, the festival app, requirements

The following are the minimal requirements for the festival app.

You are free to add other features to help the guests explore the music, like browsing by genre, searching etc

### Requirements

The system should show the following information

- the bands playing at the festival
- who's playing, where
- any cancellations that might occur.

### Using the API

The main endpoints you should be working with are:

- `/bands`
- `/schedule`
- `/events`

The bands won't change over time, but the schedule and events will.
